- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

    Classes can handle state while functional components need hooks to deal and carry state.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    
    1. comonentDidMount - mounts component to DOM aka Birth of component.
    2. componentDidUpdate - updates the component if state or data changes.
    3. componentDidUnmount - unmounts the component from the DOM aka Death of component.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

    Custom hooks extend multiple peices of stateful logic that can be reused.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

    It is important to test so bugs surface faster, reduces the risk of regression and acts as a safety net when refactoring. It can also act as documentation so other developers can understand what the code does.
